# Route-Optimization-in-Vehicles
Route Optimization in Vehicles-efficient pathfinding and optimal route planning are essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to navigate safely and effectively in complex and dynamic environments. This project focuses on the use of advanced data structures to improve the performance of pathfinding algorithms in AV systems.
